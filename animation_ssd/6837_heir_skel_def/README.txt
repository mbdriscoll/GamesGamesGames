To run and compile the code, run ./a2 data/Model1, or whatever model you want to see

I collaborated with Katie Kaufman for most of the pset, working side-by-side through the problems together. I also collaborated with Connie Chan over gchat as she helped us understand concepts. I attended office hours and provided a little help to Brodrick Childs. 

In attempting to do the textures extra credit, I found this website helpful:http://nehe.gamedev.net/tutorial/texture_mapping/12038/

There are no known problems with my code (HOORAY!)

Extra Credit: I tried to do the texture mapping, but was unable to complete it successfully by the due time. Not sure if it's worth anything, but I left the codcode that I've written so far in the loadTextures function, and smattered throughout.

This was an awesome assignment. Like! One comment though, is that it would be nice if there were more office hours. I really really appreciated that Alec came in on the day off, but I feel like there is much more demand for help than the TAs can provide in just 2 hours per week.
